PyTWS is installed like most any other pure Python library:

1. Download and extract the source archive to some temporary location.
2. Open a command line and change folders to the extracted 'pydev' folder.
3. Run the command: python setup.py install

Afterwards, you may delete the archive and extraction location if you like.
